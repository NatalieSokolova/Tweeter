# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Basides basic functional requirements, I changed the appearance of cursor on hover over the button, added a "back to the top button" that automatically activates input field, and another button that toggles the input form. Both of these buttons are animated.

In addition, this app is responsive, and would look good on desctops and most mobile devices.
